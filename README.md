# FUTURE_CS_02-Security-Alert-Monitoring-Incident-Response
Security Alert Monitoring &amp; Incident Response. Includes simulated SIEM alert monitoring, incident classification, and a detailed incident response report with remediation recommendations.
# Cybersecurity Internship - Task 2  
*Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response*  

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview  
Monitor simulated security alerts using a SIEM tool, identify suspicious activities, classify incidents, and draft an incident response report.  

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- Elastic Stack (ELK)  
- Splunk Free Trial  
- Sample Log Files  

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Gained  
- Log Analysis  
- Alert Triage  
- Incident Classification  
- SOC Operations Basics  

## ðŸ“‘ Deliverable  
- [Incident Response Report](Incident_Response_Report.docx)  

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
- Multiple failed login attempts â†’ Possible brute-force attack.  
- Successful login after failed attempts â†’ Account compromise.  
- Privilege escalation detected â†’ Post-compromise activity.  

## ðŸ”’ Remediation Recommendations  
- Enforce strong password policies & enable MFA.  
- Block suspicious IPs and monitor login attempts.  
- Reset credentials of compromised accounts.  
- Patch vulnerabilities to prevent privilege escalation.  
- Implement continuous monitoring with SIEM tools.
